First off, I'm going to need to remember Java app structure - I've been working in JS webapps for a good while. I'll
just follow the Maven structure def and separate some logical groups into packages.

I've already got a good idea of what's going to need to be a class and what can be left as configuration in the DB, so
I'll stub out my classes if for no other reason than to get some organization down where I can see it.

As far as data and configuration are concerned, I could keep everything in .conf, constants, or similar files, but
frankly I'd like to show off that I'm familiar with SQL interaction. Since this is a very light app, I'll spin up
SQLite in-memory and spawn in the necessary data at connection time (which will only tool info at this point, but still,
that's where data like this belongs).

I'm definitely going to want confirmation that I've actually set up the database correctly, so I'll write a test to
check that the connection is being created. Correct data will be checked by the rest of the suite, so I'm not going to
bother with that in the DB connection test.
