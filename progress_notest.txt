First off, I'm going to need to remember Java app structure - I've been working in JS webapps for a good while. I'll
just follow the Maven structure def and separate some logical groups into packages.

I've already got a good idea of what's going to need to be a class and what can be left as configuration in the DB, so
I'll stub out my classes if for no other reason than to get some organization down where I can see it.

As far as data and configuration are concerned, I could keep everything in .conf, constants, or similar files, but
frankly I'd like to show off that I'm familiar with SQL interaction. Since this is a very light app, I'll spin up
SQLite in-memory and spawn in the necessary data at connection time (which will only tool info at this point, but still,
that's where data like this belongs).
